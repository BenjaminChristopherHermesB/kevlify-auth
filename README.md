# Kevlify Authenticator

A secure, open-source **web-based** two-factor authentication (2FA) application inspired by [Stratum Auth](https://github.com/stratumauth/app).

![Kevlify Logo](client/public/images/logos/logo.png)

## 🎯 About This Project

Kevlify Authenticator is a **web implementation** of the concepts pioneered by [Stratum Auth](https://github.com/stratumauth/app), an excellent Android 2FA client. While Stratum Auth provides a robust mobile experience, Kevlify brings similar functionality to the web, making 2FA accessible from any device with a browser.

**Key Differences:**
- 🌐 **Cross-Platform**: Works on desktop, mobile, and tablets without installation
- ☁️ **Cloud-Ready**: Optional cloud sync via user accounts (Stratum is offline-first)
- 🔐 **Google OAuth**: Sign in with Google (in addition to traditional email/password)
- 🗄️ **Hybrid Database**: SQLite for local development, PostgreSQL for production

**Credit**: This project builds upon the excellent foundation and ideas from [Stratum Auth](https://github.com/stratumauth/app). We highly recommend their Android app for mobile users seeking a privacy-focused, offline-first 2FA solution.
